# Ask Me Anything

I am self-taught in almost everything I do. In college I studied digital media, studio engineering and recording arts. For programming languages I've dabbled in BASIC, C, Perl, PHP, Ruby, and Javascript. For natural languages I've dabbled in Japanese, Mandarin, Tagalog, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and I'm fairly good at conversational Spanish. I've tried my hand at sketch art, creative writing, practicing underground dance styles, composing electronic music...

I've studied eschatology for most of my life.

Lately I've been studying systems programming languages, penetration testing and ethical hacking, Linux system setup and administration, idempotency, machine learning, digital signal processing and sound synthesis...
